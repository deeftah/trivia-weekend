# Trivia Weekend

Trivia Weekend is a trivia team management system designed to support the thousands of team captains and players who play annually in trivia marathons that run for fifty hours, or even longer.  The application allows team captains to create and manage contests, share visual trivia images, mark questions as correct, incorrect, or in progress, and keep a transcript of questions asked.  Team members are able to view all the information team captains add and stay informed in real time when questions are answered.  They can also stay apprised of the questions they should be working on next.
